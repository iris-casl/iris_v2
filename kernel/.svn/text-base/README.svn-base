Building the manifold kernle into libmanifold.a requries Autotools.

To build and install libmanifold.a:

1. autoconf
2. automake -a
3. ./configure
OR ./configure <install_path>
By default, the library is installed in /usr/local/lib/manifold. This
can be changed by specifying a different path to configure.
4. make
5. make install
